This is a fan game I am making while I learn SpriteKit and GameKit. It is only for learning use and not for profit in anyway shape or form. Autobots and Decepticons are Copyright Hasbro and Takara Tomy.
Rules: 

You have thirty seconds to find the Hidden Autobot among the Decepticons that are disguised as autobots. 
You gain 50 points everytime you rescue the Autobot. 
You loose 5 points for every Decepticon that you find. 
If you fail uncover all Decepticons and not find the Autobot, you go down 1 level.
You only get Gameover if you let time run out.

The further you go in levels, the more Decepticons show up, and might give you hints on which are Decepticons or not. 
The Decepticon camoflage is buggy so at the beginning of every level, their camoflage flashes. This way you can easily find them. 

This works on iPhone and iPad.  Currently, the game scene is formatted for iPhone. I will be making it so it will show the correct size depending on the device.
