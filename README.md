Quick! The Autobots need your help!

You have 30 seconds to rescue the Autobot hidden among a sea of Decepticons all in disguise. Luckily for you, the Decepticon camouflage is buggy and will appear to flash at the beginning of each level.

Look carefully and rescue the Autobot by tapping one on the screen. You gain 50 points every time you rescue an Autobot. You lose 5 points for every Decepticon that you reveal. 

If you end up tapping on all the Decepticons before finding the Autobot, you will go down by 1 level. And it's game over when your time runs out. 

The more rounds you complete, the higher your level will go, and the more Decepticons will appear. Think you've got what it takes?
